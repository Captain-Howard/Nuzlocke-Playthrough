### Instructions
Just a first note: Thank you to everyone wanting to play along in this Nuzlocke! Hopefully no one dies right away haha. I created this repo though in case you don't already have all of the required files.

I recommend using RetroArch first (you can find it in Steam, or the Play Store, or just through Google if you want it standalone) HOWEVER...

If you want to use a specific emulator feel free to use [mGBA](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/mGBA-0.10.0-win64-installer.exe) (my personal favorite)

Lastly, the ROMs included in this repo should work for [RetroAchievments](https://retroachievements.org/) if you're wanting to set those up as well. 
 - [Pokemon Ruby](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Ruby%20Version%20(USA).gba)
 - [Pokemon Emerald](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Emerald%20Version%20(USA%2C%20Europe).gba)
 - [Pokemon Sapphire](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Sapphire%20Version%20(USA%2C%20Australia).gba)

Have fun and may the RNG be ever in your favour lol
