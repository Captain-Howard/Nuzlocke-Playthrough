### Instructions
Thank you to everyone wanting to play along in this Nuzlocke! Hopefully no one dies right away haha. 

I created this repo though in case you don't already have all of the required files.

## Emulator
I recommend using [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) first (you can find it in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118310/RetroArch/), or the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch&pli=1), or just on their [website](https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms) if you want it standalone) HOWEVER...

If you want to use a specific emulator feel free to use [mGBA](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/mGBA-0.10.0-win64-installer.exe) (my personal favorite)

## ROMs
Lastly, the ROMs included in this repo should work for [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/) if you're wanting to set those up as well. 
 - [Pokemon Ruby](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Ruby%20Version%20(USA).gba)
 - [Pokemon Emerald](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Emerald%20Version%20(USA%2C%20Europe).gba)
 - [Pokemon Sapphire](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Nuzlocke-Playthrough/blob/main/Pokemon%20-%20Sapphire%20Version%20(USA%2C%20Australia).gba)

Have fun and may the RNG be ever in your favour lol
